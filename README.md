# TopTrons22MesocosmIncubation
These scripts have been used to produce graphs and statistics of data from an indoor mesocosm experiment on the effects of temperature on a North Sea spring bloom community. Some of the supplementary files cannot be found in the Supplement folder but were produced from the main scripts or in excel. The publication can be accessed via https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171971. TPC data can be downloaded from **https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.961508** and all other data from **https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.961155** and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB67313.
